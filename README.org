* Project for CSE 551 Fundamentals of Algorithms

* Project Requirements:

Implement the following algorithms from the paper "Budget Constrained Relay node Placement with Minimum Number of Connected Component" (See =papers= directory). More details on this can be found in the README file in the =relay-node= directory.

** Relay Node Placement Problem with Mini-mum Number of Connected Components

Algorithm 4 in paper.

** Relay Node Placement Problem for Maximiz-ing the Largest Connected Component

Algorithm 5 in paper.

* Execution Instructions
On execution the program will run both algorithm 4 (Budget Constrained Relay node Placement with Minimum Number of Connected Components) and algorithm 5 (Budget Constrained Relay node Placement with Maximum size of Largest Connected Component) on the parameters provided.

This package includes the Clojure source code for our project (https://clojure.org/) and a precompiled, standalone JAR file. We recommend running the JAR file for simplicity, however the source code can be built (and dependencies automatically resolved) using Leiningen (Install from https://leiningen.org/#install) using the shell command =lein uberjar= in the project directory (=relay node=). To run the compiled byte code, type =java -jar relay-nodejar -c <#> -b <#> [-f <FILE PATH>] [-g <GRAPH STRING>]= in the shell with the interface variables as specified below.

The project will output the resulting graphs for algorithm 4 and algorithm 5. This will be a serialized representation of these graphs to prevent unnecessary dependencies on visualization libraries. The format of this graph will be:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Algorithm [4|5]

Graph
<# of Nodes> Nodes:
            :<Node Name> {:x <X Coord> :y <Y Coord> :z 0}
            ...
<# of Edges> Edges:
            :<Node 1 Name> <-> <Node 2 Name> {:length <Euclidean Distance Between Nodes> :weight <Number of Relays Required to Traverse>}
            // indicates Node 1 and Node 2 are adjacent in the result graph.
            ...
#+END_SRC

If a graph meeting the desired constraints could not be found, a message will state as such (Algorithm 5) or a graph with no edges will be displayed (Algorithm 4). Invalid input will be flagged with specific error messages.

* Command Line Interface
The command line interface takes a graph (filename or string representation), a communication range, and a budget. Please use the sections below for further clarification on the way to specify each parameter. If in doubt, =--help= or =-h= at the prompt will give you a list of all these options.

** Graph Encoding
The graph is encoded as a string with space and newline delimiters for easy entry. Each line corresponds to a node in the graph. All edges are inferred from the node locations and the communication range.
A line will have three space-delimited items. The first will be a string node name. This can just be a character like =A=, or an ASCII word with no spaces. These names must be unique. The second two parameters will be floating point values indicating the x and y coordinates of this node in the euclidean plane respectively. An example of this can be found below. Further examples can be found in the =loc0=, =loc1=, =loc2=, and =loc3= files in the zipped source.

** Parameters
*** Required parameters:
**** Communication Range
- Description:  The maximum effective communication range for a sensor in the euclidean plane.
-  Flag:         -c / --comm-range
-  Type:         float
-  Type Checked: True
**** Budget
- Description: The maximum budget for the sensor placement spanning tree.
- Flag:         -b / --budget
- Type:         float
- Type Checked: True
*** Additionally, one of the following must be provided:
**** Graph File
- Description: The file from which to load an encoded graph.
- Flag:         -f / --file
- Type:         File Path
- Type Checked: True
    * The file method of input is recommended, since newline and space delimited inputs can be finicky on some shells.
**** String Graph
- Description: The encoded graph to load as a string
- Flag:         -g / --graph
- Type:         Graph Encoding
- Type Checked: True (During parsing)
